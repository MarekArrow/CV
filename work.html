              <h3>Middle-office Specialist</h3>
              <p>Mainly tasks were daily valuation of investment instruments (bonds, shares, derivatives), control of data consistency in primary
                systems, asset management, calculation of portfolio and benchmark performance, proposal and implementation of control processes.
                this was associated with the priority right to work with databases and make changes. Nevertheless, these changes were made using
                the assigned system. However, SQL has often been used for control, information retrieval, and automation. Thanks to automation, I also
                gained knowledge and experience with VBA and Microsoft Access.</p>

              <h3>ING Representative</h3>
              <p>The work consisted of communication with clients, handling their requests along with establishing contracts. It was also my first
                professional meeting with the world of finance. Here I gained a practical basis for the functioning of finance, which I further
                developed. Although it was only a mutual fund, I gained knowledge about the taxation of invested assets and other specifics around
                finance.</p>

              <h3>Volunteer in movie festival Jeden Svět</h3>
              <p>The One World Film Festival deals with human rights issues and it'S organized by People in Need. My tasks here were all undivided
                work. In the final, it consisted mainly of dramaturgy, fundraising and moderator work on screenings for schools.</p>
